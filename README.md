# Artist recommendation system

 For this small challenge, we use the Last.fm data set. You can find it as a CSV file here:lastfm-matrix-germany.csv. 
 The data tells you whether a user i has listened to an artist j. In this case, it holds aij=1, otherwise 0.

 1. The data is updated when a user listens to an artist.
 2. Artists are recommended to a user. The recommendations can be based on:
 
       a. Random artists,
   
       b. Artists unknown to the user, or
   
       c. Artists that are similar to the ones they already listened to
